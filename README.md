# Air Pollution Analysis and Forecasting

## Overview
Air pollution is a major global environmental risk, adversely affecting human health and food security. It involves the release of pollutants into the atmosphere that harm both people and the planet. Policies aimed at reducing air pollution can serve as a dual-benefit strategy by improving public health and mitigating climate change.

Accurate air pollutant forecasting is essential to minimizing the impact of pollution peaks on populations and ecosystems. This work focuses on forecasting air pollutant levels to enable timely measures to reduce high pollutant concentrations.

## Objective
The objectives of this project are:

1. **Exploration of Trends**: Analyze air pollutant emissions from various provinces in Canada using time series analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of trends over time.
2. **Pollutant Level Forecasting**: Predict pollutant levels in the province with the highest emissions using the ARIMA model.
3. **Source Contribution Analysis**: Identify and analyze the primary sources responsible for high pollutant levels in each province.

## Analysis

### Data Pre-processing
The data pre-processing stage involved:
- Handling missing values (e.g., filling NaN values with mean values or removing them).
- Removing or altering outliers to improve data quality.
- Selecting relevant columns focused on key pollutants for further analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to:
- Understand the statistical properties of the dataset.
- Visualize trends and patterns in pollutant emissions.

### Forecasting with ARIMA
- The ARIMA model was used for time series forecasting of pollutant levels.
- Optimization of model parameters (‘p’, ‘d’, ‘q’) was performed, with values set to 1, 1, and 2, respectively.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Large Dataset**:
   - The dataset was extensive, requiring a subset to be selected for analysis.
   - Missing values were filled or removed to ensure data integrity.

2. **Units of Measurement**:
   - Pollutant data was in tonnes per year, making it impossible to estimate the Air Quality Index (AQI) for provinces.
   - Efforts to find authenticated AQI records were unsuccessful, leading to the use of ARIMA for forecasting.

3. **ARIMA Optimization**:
   - The optimization of `p`, `d`, and `q` parameters was challenging.
   - A thorough understanding of time series analysis was necessary before implementing the ARIMA model.
